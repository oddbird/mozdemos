    <section id="declared" class="demo-section">
      <h2>
        <strong>Declared Rules</strong> by Specificity
      </h2>
      <p>
        At the top of the rule panel,
        we can see directly targeted selector-blocks
        sorted by their relative weight:
        a combination of specificity and source-order.
        Generally rules higher up in the panel
        will overrive rules lower down.

    <section id="inherited" class="demo-section inherited">
      <h2 style="color: rebeccapurple">
        <strong>Inherited Rules</strong> by Distance
      </h2>
      <p>
        Below the targeted rules
        we can see inherited properties from ancestor selectors:
        from the closest parent
        all the way back to the document root.
        The closest ancestor will always win.

    <section id="computed" class="demo-section">
      <h2>
        <strong>Computed Values</strong> for User Agent Styles
      </h2>
      <p>
        UA Styles do not appear in the rule panel,
        but can be seen in the Computed panel.
